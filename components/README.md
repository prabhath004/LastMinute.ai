# components/

React UI components.

| Folder | Contents                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui/`  | Primitive/shadcn components (textarea, buttons, etc.) |

As the app grows, add feature-specific components at the top level of this folder (e.g. `course-card.tsx`, `scenario-view.tsx`). Keep `ui/` for low-level primitives only.
